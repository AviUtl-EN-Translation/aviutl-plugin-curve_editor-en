## How to use

After starting AviUtl, click "Curve Editor" on the "Window" menu in the main window, and the Curve Editor window appears. ([→ If the window does not appear](https://github.com/mimaraka/aviutl-plugin-curve_editor/wiki/%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0))

This plugin allows you to edit curves in the following five editing modes.

- **Normal** (former: Bezier(Multiple))
- **Bezier**
- **Elastic**
- **Bounce**
- **Script**

You can switch between these modes from the mode selection dropdown in the top left corner of the window.

- #### Normal (former: Bezier(Multiple))

  You can save up to 524288 curves to a project file using IDs from `1` to `524288`.

  In this mode, you can create a curve by freely combining four types of curves: Linear, Bezier, Elastic, and Bounce.
  Double-click on the empty part of the graph to add an anchor.
  Double-click the anchor to delete the curve.
  
  Right-click on the anchor to change the curve type for each section or to set different modifiers for each section.

- #### Bezier

  A mode that allows you to create a single third-order bezier curve.
  The curve is identified by an integer value of several digits, and the value and curve correspond to one-to-one.

- #### Elastic

  A mode that allows you to create a movement such as rubber vibrations.
  Identifies curves by integers, similar to Bezier mode. Negative values will reverse the curve.

- #### Bounce

  A mode that allows you to create a movement in which objects bounce.
  Identifies curves by integers, similar to Bezier mode. Negative values will reverse the curve.

- #### Script

  A mode that allows you to describe the function of easing directly through a Lua script.
  Like the Normal mode, you can add up to 524288 curves.

### Graph View

You can zoom in and out of the view by rotating the mouse wheel.

You can change the view position by dragging the mouse wheel or dragging the left button while pressing the `Alt` key.

### Drag & Drop

When the 「Apply」 button is pressed, the button changes to the 「Apply by dragging and dropping onto the trackbar」. 
Drag the trackbar to the trackbar Movement Change Button without letting go of the left mouse button as it is.

When the cursor hover over the Movement Change Button of trackbar , the button is highlighted.
If you drop the curve over the track bar you want to apply it, the curve is applied.

[→ Drag & Drop is not working](https://github.com/mimaraka/aviutl-plugin-curve_editor/wiki/%E3%83%88%E3%83%A9%E3%83%96%E3%83%AB%E3%82%B7%E3%83%A5%E3%83%BC%E3%83%86%E3%82%A3%E3%83%B3%E3%82%B0)

> [!TIP]
> By dragging and dropping with the Shift key, you can set the easing individually for each coordinate even for the track bar where the easing, such as the XYZ coordinates, is set at once.
